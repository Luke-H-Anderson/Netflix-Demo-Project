# Netflix-Demo-Project
This is a side project I worked on in Tableau while perfecting my craft in Tableau.
It consists of the original content on Netflix, where it was produced, and other 
measurements such as the number of movies and TV shows, the top ten genres, the 
ratings count for all content, and the number of movies and TV shows by year.

At the very top you'll notice some other specific characteristics. If you choose to explore the 
dashboard, which can be done by clicking the link at the end of this description. You will be 
able to choose a specific piece of content based off whether it is a movie or TV show. 
If you're curious as to how this dashboard can be used, feel free to watch the video.
